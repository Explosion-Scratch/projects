# Welcome!

Hi there! This is the part of [my website](https://explosion-scratch.github.io) with all of my JavaScript projects! Some of them are listed below:

- [Scratch API](https://explosion-scratch.github.io/api.html)

  A simple find and replace javscript app I made.
- [Email verify](https://explosion-scratch.github.io/email_verify.html)
  A simple thing I made to verify that emails are actually possible emails.
- [Some buttons I made that are super fun to click.](buttons.html)
  Seriously. Test them out, it's super fun to click them, especially super fast lol

- [A cool HTML parser](html_parser.html)
  This parses HTML and you can also put inline styles and inline code! (It also keeps it when reloading using localstorage)

- [Note-Taker](notetaking.html)
  A note-taking web app I made that stores your notes in cookies

- [Random background generator](random_image.html)
  This generates random background images using unsplash images' API.

  A cool JS clock that I made. (My first JS project)
- [Input styling test](https://explosion-scratch.github.io/input.html)
  A Test for some nice input styles.
- [BBCode parser!](https://explosion-scratch.github.io/to_bbcode.html)
  This was hard to make.
