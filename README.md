# Welcome!

Hi there! This is the part of [my website](https://explosion-scratch.github.io/https://explosion-scratch.github.io) with all of my JavaScript projects! Some of them are listed below:

*   [Scratch API](https://explosion-scratch.github.io/api.html)  
    This was something I made to try out jQuery. It gets the data of a specified user from Lefty's API.
*   [Find and Replace](https://explosion-scratch.github.io/find_and_replace.html)  
    A simple find and replace javscript app I made.
*   [Email verify](https://explosion-scratch.github.io/email_verify.html)  
    A simple thing I made to verify that emails are actually possible emails.
*   [Some buttons I made that are super fun to click.](buttons.html)  
    Seriously. Test them out, it's super fun to click them, especially super fast lol  

*   [A cool HTML parser](html_parser.html)  
    This parses HTML and you can also put inline styles and inline code! (It also keeps it when reloading using localstorage)  

*   [Note-Taker](notetaking.html)  
    A note-taking web app I made that stores your notes in cookies  

*   [Random background generator](random_image.html)  
    This generates random background images using unsplash images' API.  

*   [A Clock](clock.html)  
    A cool JS clock that I made. (My first JS project)
*   [Input styling test](https://explosion-scratch.github.io/input.html)  
    A Test for some nice input styles.
*   [BBCode parser!](https://explosion-scratch.github.io/to_bbcode.html)  
    This was hard to make.
